# Quick Task 011: Summary

## What Changed
Added `("D", "Refresh Devices")` to the ACTIONS list in `kflash/screen.py`. The key handler already existed in `tui.py` (line 583) but wasn't displayed. Now renders at the top of the second column in the actions panel.

## File Changed
- `kflash/screen.py` — ACTIONS list (line 82)
