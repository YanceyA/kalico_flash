# kalico-flash

## What This Is

A Python TUI tool that automates Klipper/Kalico firmware building and flashing for USB-connected MCU boards on a Raspberry Pi. Features interactive TUI menu, print safety checks, post-flash verification, and comprehensive error recovery. Replaces the manual workflow of make clean, make menuconfig, make, make flash with auto-discovery, device profiles, cached configs, and a single-command flow.

## Core Value

One command to build and flash any registered board — no remembering serial paths, flash commands, or config locations.

## Previous Milestone: v4.0 Remove CLI & Internalize Device Keys (shipped 2026-02-01)

**Goal:** Remove all CLI/argparse elements and make device keys auto-generated internal identifiers — the tool operates exclusively through TUI
**Outcome:** All CLI infrastructure removed. Device keys auto-generated from display names. Tool is now purely TUI-driven.

## Previous State (v4.0 shipped)

**Shipped:** 2026-02-01
**Modules:** 14 Python modules (including validation.py)
**LOC:** ~6,371 lines of Python
**Status:** Pure TUI application. No CLI flags. Device keys auto-generated internally. All documentation reflects TUI-only operation.

### Future Candidates

- [ ] SHA256 change detection to skip rebuild when config unchanged
- [ ] --no-clean flag for incremental builds
- [ ] CAN bus device support

### Out of Scope

- RPi MCU flashing — different workflow (linux process, not USB serial)
- CAN bus device discovery — USB only for now
- Moonraker/Fluidd web UI integration — TUI only, architecture supports future integration
- Firmware version tracking/rollback — requires infrastructure
- Automatic klipper git pull — dangerous, user manages source updates
- curses-based TUI — complexity and Windows issues, print/input sufficient
- Moonraker URL configuration — hardcoded localhost:7125, keep it simple

## Context

- **Target environment:** Raspberry Pi running Klipper/Moonraker/Fluidd (MainsailOS or similar)
- **Klipper fork:** Kalico (https://docs.kalico.gg) — not mainline Klipper
- **Boards:**
  - Octopus Pro v1.1 — STM32H723, USB, 128kb bootloader, 25kHz clock
  - Nitehawk 36 — RP2040, USB, 16kb bootloader, !gpio8 at start
  - Beacon probe — Registered as non-flashable
- **Serial paths:** Use /dev/serial/by-id/ symlinks (stable across reboots), match klipper pattern only
- **Flash methods:** Both boards support katapult (flashtool.py) and make flash. Katapult is preferred, make flash is fallback.
- **Klipper source:** ~/klipper (default), Katapult source: ~/katapult (default)
- **menuconfig:** ncurses TUI, must run with inherited stdio (subprocess.run, not check_output)
- **Permissions:** User has passwordless sudo (standard for MainsailOS/FluiddPi)

### Reference Commands

**Octopus Pro (H723):**
```
python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_stm32h723xx_29001A001151313531383332-if00
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32h723xx_29001A001151313531383332-if00
```

**Nitehawk 36 (RP2040):**
```
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_rp2040_30333938340A53E6-if00
python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_rp2040_30333938340A53E6-if00
```

## Constraints

- **Python version**: 3.9+ stdlib only — no pip installs, no external dependencies
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi (ARM Linux) — must work over SSH
- **Working directory**: make commands must run with cwd=klipper_dir
- **Service management**: sudo systemctl stop/start klipper (passwordless sudo assumed)
- **Deployment**: Git clone + ./install.sh on Pi

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Katapult-first with auto-fallback | Katapult is preferred flash method; make flash as safety net | ✓ Good |
| Single serial pattern per device (klipper mode only) | Katapult mode requires manual DFU entry, too complex for this tool | ✓ Good |
| menuconfig runs every flash (unless skip option) | User wants option to tweak config each time | ✓ Good |
| No dry-run | SSH workflow doesn't benefit enough to justify complexity | ✓ Good |
| Stdlib only | Raspberry Pi environment, avoid dependency management | ✓ Good |
| Context manager for service lifecycle | Guarantees restart even on exception/Ctrl+C | ✓ Good |
| Hub-and-spoke architecture | Clean separation, no cross-imports between modules | ✓ Good |
| Dataclass contracts for cross-module data | Strong typing, clear interfaces | ✓ Good |
| Late imports in TUI launcher | Fast startup, only load what's needed | ✓ Good |
| Graceful degradation for Moonraker | Return None on failure, never raise; warn but don't block | ✓ Good |
| Version check informational only | Never blocks flash, just shows warning if outdated | ✓ Good |
| No --force for print blocking | Safety first - wait or cancel print, no override | ✓ Good |
| Print/input TUI (not curses) | Simpler, no Windows issues, works over SSH | ✓ Good |
| format_error() for all error output | Consistent 80-column wrapped output with context | ✓ Good |
| Symlink over wrapper script | Direct symlink to flash.py, uses Python shebang | ✓ Good |
| 30s verification timeout | RP2040 boards need more time to re-enumerate | ✓ Good |
| Truecolor with ANSI 16 fallback | Modern terminals support RGB; Pi SSH terminals vary | ✓ Good |
| Flash All: stop once, flash all, restart | Faster than per-device stop/restart cycle | ✓ Good |
| Reject-and-reprompt for invalid paths | User gets immediate feedback, not runtime errors later | ✓ Good |
| Content checks on paths (Makefile, flashtool.py) | Confirms right directory, not just any directory | ✓ Good |
| Stdlib only for TUI redesign | No Rich/Textual — pure ANSI codes, maintain constraint | ✓ Good |
| Auto-generated slug keys from display name | No user prompt for key, reduces friction | ✓ Good |
| Thin TUI launcher with TTY guard | No arg parsing at all, clean entry point | ✓ Good |
| TUI action names in error recovery text | Users see "Add Device from the main menu" not key shortcuts | ✓ Good |
| Preserve existing device keys on load | No re-derivation risk, backward compatible | ✓ Good |
